👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello, I'm J.Himaja, a dedicated enthusiast in the field of Python programming. I recently completed the CodeSoft Internship in the Python programming domain, and I'm excited to share the outcomes of the three engaging tasks that I worked on.

🚀 Projects from CodeSoft:

TO-DO LIST: 
Implemented a basic to-do list interface allowing users to input tasks, display them in a list format, and delete tasks from the list as desired so that users can easily add and manage their tasks within this simple application.

SIMPLE CALCULATOR: 
Designed a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display the result.

PASSWORD GENERATOR: 
This application generates strong and random passwords, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

🔍 What to Expect: Dive into my repositories to explore these projects. I'm committed to refining and expanding my skills, and I'm eager to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts.

Happy coding! 🚀✨
